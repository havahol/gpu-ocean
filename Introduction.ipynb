    "The main purpose of this software is to provide code that evaluate the test cases presented in the paper, and reproduce the results. As a consequence, the implementation of the four numerical schemes are also provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is written in Python, whereas the numerical schemes are implemented in OpenCL and accessed through the PyOpenCL library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each case is represented by a Jupyter Notebook. In some cases, two notebooks are provided for a single case, meaning that the first notebook sets up the case and run all simulations, and the second notebook reads the results from file and creates the plots presented in the paper."

    "- `python/SWESimulators` contains python modules for each scheme and a selection of utility classes and functions.\n",
